The news room challenge: We have built three clients served by one API.
We built a newspaper platform with the user client, the admin client and a user mobile client with React Native.

- [Mobile](https://github.com/emiliano-ma/mobile_good_morning_news)
- [Admin](https://github.com/emiliano-ma/client_admin_good_morning_news)
